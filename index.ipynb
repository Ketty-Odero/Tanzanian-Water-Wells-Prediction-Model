    "Tanzania is in the midst of a crisis, out of its 65 million population, 55%  and 11% of rural and urban population respectively, do not have access to clean water. People living under these circumstances, particularly women and girls, spend a significant amount of time traveling long distances to collect water.This poses significant risks in public health, economic productivity and educational opportunities.Now more than everaccess to safe water at home is critical to families in Tanzania."
