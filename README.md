# Tanzanian-Water-Wells-Prediction-Model
This repository builds a model to predict functionality of pumps using the Tanzanian Water Wells dataset

# ðŸ“– Overview
This project analyzes Tanzanian water wells to assess their functionality and identify key factors affecting well performance. Using a dataset of over 59,000 water points, we classify wells as:
Functional
Non-functional
Functional but needs repair
The goal is to provide actionable insights to improve water resource management in Tanzania and prioritize repairs or replacements.
